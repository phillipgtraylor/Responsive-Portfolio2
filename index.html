			<p>Hello there, my name is Phillip Traylor but you were probably already able to ascertain that from my page that you are currently visiting. I am currently working on honing my skills in the high tech field in hopes of being part of something that is important someday.  I love learning about web development so I never plan to stop even once I do find that special job opportunity someday. I am hopeful that I will be able to embark on a career once I finish up with this boot camp through UT. Outside of coding, I enjoy working out and trying new foods. I am also learning about the distilling industry as a hobby/interest. Thanks for visiting!</p>
